# MNIST-Images-Generation-with-GAN
This project is my first hands-on with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The goal was to generate **really realistic MNIST digit images starting from random noise**.
___
## Tech Stack ##

- Keras

- Custom training loops

- Matplotlib (for visualization)

- CNNs

The generator creates digit-like images from random noise, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake MNIST digits. Over time, both networks improve and the generated images start looking surprisingly realistic.
